# jless Website

This branch (`website`) contains code to generate the jless website,
[jless.io](https://jless.io).

The website is currently hosted on Netlify, which publishes the `dist`
directory. Run `./main.rb` to generate the three pages on the website:
- `dist/index.html` (generated by `home_page.rb`)
- `dist/user-guide.html` (generated by `user_guide_page.rb`)
- `dist/releases.html` (generated by `releases_page.rb`)

When making new releases I'll update `releases_page.rb` manually.
